 Risk Management: Identifying and mitigating risks early in the development process reduces the likelihood of major issues later.
 Cost and Time Efficiency: Effective software engineering helps manage project scope, timelines, and budgets, reducing the risk of cost overruns and delays.
 Maintainability: Promotes the creation of software that is easy to update and maintain, allowing for efficient management of bug fixes, enhancements, and changes.



Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

  The evolution of software engineering has been marked by several key milestones that have significantly shaped the field. Here are three notable milestones:
  The Development of the Waterfall Model (1970s): The Waterfall model, introduced by Dr. Winston W. Royce in 1970, was one of the earliest formalized software development methodologies. It is a sequential design process with distinct phases,Requirements, Design, Implementation, Verification, and Maintenance.
  The Emergence of Agile Methodologies (1990s-2000s): Agile methodologies, including Scrum, Extreme Programming (XP), and the Agile Manifesto (published in 2001), introduced a new approach focused on iterative development, collaboration, and adaptability. Agile emphasizes delivering working software in small, incremental stages, and regularly incorporating feedback from users.
  The Rise of DevOps (2010s): DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to enhance collaboration and automate the software delivery process. It focuses on continuous integration, continuous delivery (CI/CD), and infrastructure as code (IaC) to streamline development and deployment.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

 The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) typically includes the following phases:
   Planning : In this phase involves defining the software’s purpose and scope, much like pinpointing our destination and plotting the best route. We uncover the tasks at hand during this phase and strategize for efficient execution.
   Analysis Phase:In this phase, stakeholders' needs and requirements are collected and analyzed to understand what the software must accomplish. This includes identifying user requirements, system specifications, and any constraints.

  Design phase:Is all about building the framework. The development team is responsible for software engineering and outlines the software’s functionality and aesthetic. This ultimately results in the software product. The emphasis lies on outlining the software’s structure, navigation, user interfaces, and database design. This phase ensures that the software is user-friendly and performs its tasks efficiently.

 Coding phase: in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is when engineers and developers get down to business and start converting the software design into tangible code.

 Testing Phase:Explanation: In the testing phase, the software is rigorously tested to ensure it meets the requirements and is free of defects. Various types of testing, such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing, are conducted to validate the software's functionality and performance.
  
  Deployment Phase: After crafting a product with precision, it’s time to present it to the users by pushing to the production environment. The Deployment phase involves rolling out the meticulously tested and fine-tuned software to its end-users.

  Maintenanc Phase: After deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase, where it is updated and patched to fix bugs, address issues, and adapt to changing requirements or environments. Maintenance ensures that the software continues to perform well and remains relevant over time.
